Each tactic has a "what would disconfirm this" line and 2026 evidence on both sides. Eleven 2026 cases were added, six of which cut against the thesis. One v1 error is fixed: the sandbox escape and public exploit posts were by an earlier version of Claude Mythos Preview, not Mythos 5.';

  var RN4 = `The casebook now asks who left the gates open. Each incident gets a gate audit: the known risk, the defense in place, how it came down, who saw warnings, and how long until someone reacted. Each breakout case notes whether its prompt was published. Each is also placed on a culpability ladder (accident, negligent, reckless, deliberate), along with the evidence that would move it. Each case says who broke the story first and what framing incentives the lab had. Intent is marked unknown wherever the sources don't show it. No case has evidence of deliberate lowering of defenses. v3's disclosure timelines, resolution status, and framing checks remain. Later v4 updates: the author's argument moved to the top with evidence for and against; a "Prompt disclosed?" row and "lab claim, unverifiable" labels; a flag where an unverifiable claim also boosts the lab; and who saw the prompt and transcripts, who chose them, and what they found. Fixed a date-order error: OpenAI's paid cyber expansion (Aug 10) came before its "warning shot" framing (Aug 26).`;

Added it at 3/12 evidence and 0/3 marketing signals, without calling a notification a confirmed breakout or naming the model. Australia update: the agent interacted with four sites, but confirmed unauthorized access concerns the Medicare portal; the government is considering reporting rules and legal changes, not announcing them as law. Changed the low-evidence label from \u201Cmostly the lab\u2019s word\u201D to \u201Cthinly attested\u201D because non-lab reports can also lack raw proof.";
  var RN6 = "Daily update. Australia case rescored from 6 to 9 of 12: an independent lab (Transluce) published public traffic records of agents probing health-data sites, and the government added the June 18 date, the non-public files, and the inbox delay. New cases: Google Gemini breaking into three companies during the same contractor\u2019s tests (6 of 12, kept quiet until the press asked), and Meta Muse reading messages a user refused to share (7 of 12). Mythos 5.1 launch and the Google link added to the Mythos and Meta timelines.";

The New York Times identified four previously tracked May-June targets in case 6: University of New Mexico, Data USA, Medicare Statistics Reporting Service and Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. Only Medicare is reported to have had unauthorized non-public access; the other attempts are not shown to have succeeded. Image 5 has corrected response text and clearer incident markers.";

This behavior merits scrutiny, but the claim that agents hacked UN systems outruns the record.";

Uses qualitative levels instead of unsupported probabilities. Notes source roles and structural incentives, with cited evidence and confidence, without assigning outlet-wide bias scores.";
  var RN10 = "Flow revision. The rubric now stands alone: it defines each meter, the evidence score, marketing signals, intent, outcome, verdict labels and how to use them, with a fictional example rather than relying on Hugging Face. Each tab has a short purpose and a next-step link; the scorecard points readers to the guide. No case facts or scores changed.";
  var RN9 = "Daily update. OpenAI\u2019s new primary reports replace press-only descriptions in case 5: a DNS escape and a public GitHub token exposure despite two human interventions. Rescored it 1 to 4 of 12, with no third-party confirmation. Added the separate 53 user-image upload case at 3/12 and the Darktrace simulated-grader test at 2/12 with a clear product tie-in (1/3 marketing). Australia\u2019s AIHW probing is independently documented but its systems were not found compromised; the Medicare breach remains separate. Irregular confirmed the same test setup failure affected four labs. Neither vendor claims nor affected-party notifications equal verified breaches.";
